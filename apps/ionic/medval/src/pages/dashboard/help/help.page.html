    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>This application is designed to help Orthodontic Clinics and Dental Clinics improve the {{consumerLabel}} experience,&nbsp;by&nbsp;keeping an
      eye on overall&nbsp;{{consumerLabel}}&nbsp;sentiment, addressing&nbsp;problems with the experience, and focusing on the top
      reasons for {{consumerLabel}} dissatisfaction. Perception is everything, and so&nbsp;this app includes features to avoid bad
      online reviews and&nbsp;help happy customers give you positive&nbsp;online reviews with richer content.</p>
    <p>This document may use the term 'Orthodontic Clinic', but the features apply equally to General Dentistry as well.</p>
    <p>This App should be installed on an iPad&nbsp;and used inside your clinic (e.g. at your&nbsp;reception desk).</p>
    <p>If you are wondering why we built this app, scroll down to the '<a href="#whyexist">Why does this app exist</a>'
      section.</p>
    <h2>Application Modes</h2>
    <p>This application has two modes: the <em>Administrative Mode</em>, and <em>Feedback Mode.</em> When you
      log in, you automatically enter the Administrative Mode, and you see the Dashboard screen. All administrative
      functions (Account Settings, Staff Information, Reports, Follow-ups, etc.) are accessible from the Dashboard.</p>
    <p>You can enter the Feedback Mode by clicking on the Enter Feedback mode button on the Dashboard. This is a
      one-way 'trap-door'; once you enter Feedback mode, you have to log back in to go to Administrative mode.</p>
    <p>Once you enter the Feedback Mode, it is safe to keep this app anywhere in your clinic, at a location that is most
      convenient for&nbsp;you and your {{consumerLabel}}s.</p>
    <h2>Feedback Mode</h2>
    <p>When you enter feedback mode from the dashboard there are two survey types available:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Default, Organic survey: This is the short form&nbsp;{{consumerLabel}}-sentiment survey that can be completed in less
        than a minute.
      </li>
      <li>5-minute CAHPS-based survey: This survey includes questions from categories outlined by&nbsp;CAHPS.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>The Survey Start page</h3>
    <p>This page either displays a 'Begin' button or two buttons side-by-side: Default and CAHPS-based. Both the Begin
      and Default buttons kick off the Organic survey.&nbsp;When a {{consumerLabel}} completes a survey, the app automatically
      cycles back to the start page, showing the 'Begin' button only. When you use the Magic 'Tool' icon (below), the
      start page shows side-by-side icons for both survey types.</p>
    <h3>The Magic 'Tool' Icon in the header</h3>
    <p>The application header has&nbsp;a 'tool' icon on the top right. It is specifically designed to avoid grabbing a
      {{consumerLabel}}'s attention when the {{consumerLabel}} is going through the survey. If clicked while&nbsp;in the middle of a survey,
      the app goes back to the start page, showing side-by-side&nbsp;buttons for both survey types.</p>
    <p>Clicking&nbsp;the 'Tool' icon while on the survey start page will log you out. This is useful when you want to go
      back to Administrator mode.</p>
    <h3>Survey Questions</h3>
    <p>All surveys ask the overall favorability question: Would you recommend XYZ Clinic to friends and family?</p>
    <p>The Organic survey employs unique&nbsp;survey question types to minimize the amount of time spent by the {{consumerLabel}},
      but still useful signals about what is important to them. The question types are mostly graphical, and although&nbsp;text
      feedback options are provided, they are&nbsp;rarely used&nbsp;by {{consumerLabel}}s.</p>
    <p>The CAHPS based survey asks questions about which staff members the user interacted with, ratings for those
      staff, and questions about the quality of doctors, assistants, and front office.</p>
    <p>Survey Questions for DDS role/staff cover the&nbsp;following areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Overall favorability (e.g.: Would you recommend Dr. XYZ...)</li>
      <li>Friendliness/Courtsey&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Medical Skill</li>
      <li>Responsiveness - addressing questions/concerns</li>
      <li>Interest in/focus on positive outcomes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Survey Questions for Orthodontic/Dental Assistants cover the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Overall favorability</li>
      <li>Friendliness/Courtsey</li>
      <li>Medical Skill</li>
      <li>Responsiveness - addressing questions/concerns</li>
      <li>Interest in/focus on positive outcomes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Survey Questions for Front Office covers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Overall favorability</li>
      <li>Quality of financial information/payment follow ups</li>
      <li>Ease of Appointments</li>
      <li>Wait time</li>
      <li>Cleanliness</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>{{consumerLabelUpperCase}} data is never stored on the device; it is immediately encrypted and sent to the backend, and stored&nbsp;in&nbsp;encrypted&nbsp;<a
      href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS</a>&nbsp;servers. Data is never sent in plaintext. If someone
      compromises your device, they cannot access any {{consumerLabel}} data without having your username/password.</p>
    <h2>{{consumerLabelUpperCase}} Attractions/Features</h2>
    <p>We've built-in several features to encourage {{consumerLabel}} reviews through Organic surveys. Some of these are enabled
      by default:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Wheel of Fortune: {{consumerLabelUpperCase}}s who provide a review and are not unhappy with the experience can play a game to win
        a gift card. Please explore&nbsp;the 'Account Settings' page and tap on the help icons for more help on how to
        set this up. This feature is disabled by default.
      </li>
      <li>Humor: Laughter is the best medicine. This app includes a screensaver on the 'Start' page while in Feedback
        Mode and the Thank you page after a survey is&nbsp;completed. While this app is sitting at your reception desk,
        it will cycle through this humor,&nbsp;putting a smile on your {{consumerLabel}}'s faces! This feature is enabled by
        default.
      </li>
      <li>Chimes: While on the 'Start' page in Feedback mode, the application will play various short 2 second notes to
        attract attention and register its presence. This can be an attraction both for office staff and {{consumerLabel}}s who
        are waiting around the reception area. This feature is enabled by default.
      </li>
      <li>Verbal Thank you: At the Thank you page, this application will use a child-like voice to thank the {{consumerLabel}} for
        their feedback. This is disabled by default and still in experimental phase. Your feedback is most welcome!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>What you can do to encourage more organic feedback</h3>
    <p>We recommend you encourage your {{consumerLabel}}s to use this app once or twice and after that, rely more on organic
      traffic (i.e. {{consumerLabel}}s using the app without prompting). Here are some ideas on how to attract {{consumerLabel}} attention
      organically:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a poster (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_DVBQPEGyq1czNPV1dKYVVSa2c/view?usp=sharing"
                              target="_blank">idea #1</a>, <a
        href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_DVBQPEGyq1U3V3OE1LZ3RXNGM/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">idea #2</a>)
        that you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1OA79H" target="_blank">place above the iPad</a>&nbsp;stand&nbsp;can
        be a great start.Contact us at <a href="mailto:questions.revvolve.io" target="_blank">questions.revvolve.io </a>if you need
        help customizing these ideas.
      </li>
      <li>Place a larger poster near&nbsp;your operating area/chairs either on the wall or using a <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FK9JF2U" target="_blank">floor stand</a>. This is&nbsp;an&nbsp;effective
        way to remind {{consumerLabel}}s about this app!
      </li>
      <li>Once a month or quarter, send&nbsp;an&nbsp;email to your {{consumerLabel}}s outlining the improvements you've made, in
        words your {{consumerLabel}}s can understand. If {{consumerLabel}}s feel that feedback is important to you and you act on it, they
        will give more feedback!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Administrative Mode</h2>
    <h3>Account Settings</h3>
    <p>On this page, adjust the behavior of the application by customizing your settings.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Staff Settings</h3>
    <p>You can setup the staff members, assigning the names, titles, and roles. You can transfer pictures to the iPad
      photo library (or take pictures with the iPad itself if you prefer), and&nbsp;then use those pictures when setting
      up staff members.</p>
    <p>If you setup your staff members, the&nbsp;CAHPS-based survey will&nbsp;gather information about individual staff
      members the {{consumerLabel}} has worked with.</p>
    <h3>Reporting</h3>
    <p>We generate reports on a weekly basis, and sometimes on a daily basis. We use the terms promoters and detractors
      in this context. Please see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter" target="_blank">this article</a>&nbsp;about
      the NPS scale and promoter/detractor scores.</p>
    <p>There are three kinds of reports:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Summary Reports cover how many&nbsp;survey sessions you had, how&nbsp;many promoters and detractors you have,
        and the&nbsp;trend in your overall NPS score etc.
      </li>
      <li>Influencer Reports cover how your promoters and detractors think&nbsp;the various metrics for your business
        affect their ratings. For instance, most promoters may think&nbsp;your top strength is 'Ease of Appointments.'
        Or your detractors may think that lack of 'genuine interest' in {{consumerLabel}} outcomes is the main reason for their
        dissatisfaction. These reports are credible if there are at least 50 reviews in the system. These influencer
        reports can tell you top influencers for the top-level NPS metric, and for overall ratings at the role and staff
        levels.
      </li>
      <li>Drill down into detailed metrics:&nbsp;You can see how&nbsp;you are doing on individual metrics across roles
        and staff members.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>At the&nbsp;moment, you can request raw data to be emailed to your registered email address, from the App. This
      feature is likely to&nbsp;require a subscription in the future.</p>
    <h3>{{consumerLabelUpperCase}} Follow-ups</h3>
    <p>In the context of this app, there are broadly speaking three cases where {{consumerLabel}} follow-ups&nbsp;become
      pertinent:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A {{consumerLabel}} is very happy, and wants to provide an online review, and provides an email/phone number to receive
        instructions for a review. In this case, the app automatically follows up with the {{consumerLabel}}.
      </li>
      <li>A {{consumerLabel}} is unhappy and&nbsp;requested followup from the contact person. in this case, you need to follow up
        with a specific individual. You&nbsp;may look up their {{consumerLabel}} records based on their contact information
        provided.
      </li>
      <li>A {{consumerLabel}} is unhappy but did not provide their contact information for follow-up. In this case, you will need
        to follow up with all {{consumerLabel}}s in a given one-hour period.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For confidentiality reasons, we can't share the exact time of feedback for any {{consumerLabel}}s at this time. Please
      contact us at <a href="mailto:questions.revvolve.io" target="_blank">questions.revvolve.io</a>&nbsp;for urgent cases where you
      need more data about {{consumerLabel}} feedback.</p>
    <h3>Help and Suggestions&nbsp;</h3>
    <p>There are several&nbsp;ways&nbsp;to send us suggestions and access help content:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use the built in contextual help, usually indicated by a help icon. Click on the item to see the help
        content.
      </li>
      <li>Send us suggestions by using the Suggestion link on the Dashboard</li>
      <li>Email us directly at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:questions.revvolve.io" target="_blank">questions.revvolve.io </a>if you need
        help
      </li>
      <li>Visit our website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.revvolve.io/md" target="_blank">revvolve.io/md</a></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Including this App into your day-to-day operations</h2>
    <h3>Placement</h3>
    <p>There are plenty of options for routine placement, but we highly recommend you keep the iPad stationed at the
      reception desk or a kiosk stand.</p>
    <h3>Encouraging {{consumerLabelUpperCase}}s to provide regular feedback</h3>
    <p>Studies show that {{consumerLabel}}s are highly likely to&nbsp;do a survey if asked by&nbsp;staff in a healthcare
      environment. However, we encourage you to only do so for the longer CAHPS-based survey. For regular feedback, we
      recommend that you create a setting where {{consumerLabel}}s provide you with feedback through the organic survey.</p>
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>We highly recommend you&nbsp;enable <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201472" target="_blank">Find my
      iPhone</a>. In case your iPad is lost or stolen, this Apple-sponsored system can help you recover it.&nbsp;For
      additional anti-theft security, you can use a <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-SecureBack-Security-Clicksafe-2-K39309US/dp/B005J7Y7XA" target="_blank">Kensington&nbsp;Lock</a>.
      It works great with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/asin/B006SRUNXS" target="_blank">Kantek
        Tablet&nbsp;Stand</a>.</p>
    <h3>Purchasing a stand for your iPad</h3>
    <p>At the reception desk, the following stands have worked well for customers:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HNJNPRK" target="_blank">Wooden Desktop Stand</a>: This is ideal
        in cases where you have a full-time front desk receptionist, so the chances of theft are low. This is also a
        great option if you want to occasionally&nbsp;carry the iPad around without wrestling with clamps etc.
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/asin/B006SRUNXS" target="_blank">Kantek Tablet&nbsp;Stand</a>:
        This works well if you plan to&nbsp;remove the iPad rarely. It's fairly hard to take out the iPad from this
        stand.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Why does this app exist?</h1>
    <h2>Traditional survey methodologies don't work very well</h2>
    <p>On the average, traditional survey methodologies (the web, email, snail-mail) yield limited response rates (less
      than 20%), are expensive to administer ($30/response) and&nbsp;do not yield timely feedback (36 day response
      time). Traditional methodologies rely on surveys (<a
        href="https://www.ahrq.gov/cahps/surveys-guidance/dental/about/survey-measures.html" target="_blank">based on
        CAHPS</a>)&nbsp;that take between 5 and 10 minutes to complete. Although&nbsp;longer&nbsp;surveys are important
      for reporting purposes or certification, they can only be administered once in a while, and are therefore not a
      reliable way to keep an eye on {{consumerLabel}} sentiment.</p>
    <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/revvolveapp/marketing/traditional_surveys.jpg" alt="" width="800"/></p>
    <h2>How does this app improve over traditional surveys?</h2>
    <p>This app supports both traditional surveys&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.ahrq.gov/cahps/surveys-guidance/dental/about/survey-measures.html" target="_blank">based on
      CAHPS</a>&nbsp;and short organic surveys designed to measure {{consumerLabel}} sentiment in the shortest time possible. The
      default setting for surveys is the short, organic survey.</p>
    <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/revvolveapp/marketing/revvolve_circle.jpg" alt="" width="800"/></p>
    <h2>In-visit Surveys are the future</h2>
    <p>Conversations with {{consumerLabel}}s&nbsp;during their&nbsp;visit is one of the most effective methods to gain feedback,
      make improvements and close the loop. This app is a great way to start and sustain that conversation over the long
      term.</p>
    <h2>We have great Online Reviews! Do we need this app?</h2>
    <p>If you are receiving great Online Reviews on a regular basis, that's awesome, and you may not need this app.
      However, most Doctors agree that even one or two bad online reviews can have a detrimental impact on their work,
      and the only remedy is to have as many great reviews as possible. 60% of {{consumerLabel}}s pay more attention to actual
      {{consumerLabel}} comments than the star ratings.&nbsp;This app provides the following features to address these issues:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The app is proactive about getting more&nbsp;reviews from your <em>most satisfied</em> {{consumerLabel}}s.</li>
      <li>This app helps {{consumerLabel}}s&nbsp;provide richer content in their reviews.</li>
      <li>Providing an online review for Google can require searching for the page, finding the right site, etc. This
        app makes all that easier for {{consumerLabel}}s.
      </li>
      <li>You can configure the app to&nbsp;focus on the channels (facebook/google/yelp) that you care about.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>But we only get a few complaints a month</h2>
    <p>The impact of dissatisfied {{consumerLabel}}s is very high,&nbsp;and not everyone complains or lets you know. According to
      most experts in the field, for everyone who complains,&nbsp;<strong><strong>20 dissatisfied {{consumerLabel}}s&nbsp;do
        not<sup>1</sup>. Of</strong></strong>&nbsp;those dissatisfied {{consumerLabel}}s&nbsp;who <em>do not</em> complain, 90%
      will not&nbsp;refer their friends or family to your clinic.</p>
    <p>The cost to your business from unhappy {{consumerLabel}}s is high. It costs ten&nbsp;times as much to attract new {{consumerLabel}}s&nbsp;as
      it does to keep current ones, and changing a poor image takes 5-10 years on average. It's easy to slide into
      complacency, even for the best-run businesses!</p>
    <h3 *ngIf="medicalVertical">Why is {{consumerLabelUpperCase}} Satisfaction or {{consumerLabelUpperCase}} Sentiment Important for medical practices?</h3>
    <p *ngIf="medicalVertical">Here's a nice diagram we put together based on research from
      multiple sources. {{consumerLabelUpperCase}} Satisfaction is not just important in principle; it is critical to your bottom line.</p>
